My name is Cameron Ward. I was born and raised in Riverdale, GA and moved out to Houston, TX in 2019. I've been wanting to be a software engineer since 2012 and on my purpose journey, I've finally got the time and resources to make my dreams come true. I enjoy traveling and eating at resturants I've never tried before. I have a passion for roller skating and I play pick-up basketball from time to time. I've also recently started bowling, playing golf, pickelball and chess.
I wish to participate in outsoucing projects.
My primary tech skills are: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I'd be willing to relocate for a software engineering position.
